## The basic functions
This script checks for the presence of Flask, virtual environment, and SQLAlchemy on your system, and installs them if they are not already present. This ensures that you have all the necessary dependencies installed for your Python Flask project.

## start flask app
This Python script automates the creation of basic files required to start a Flask application. Running the createapp.py script generates a template folder, a static folder, and the base.html, index.html, style.css, and script.js files in their respective folders. This saves time and ensures that the necessary files are created in the correct locations.

## start the app
Finally, the script executes the app.py script that it created to launch the Flask application. This starts the server and allows you to view the application in a web browser.
